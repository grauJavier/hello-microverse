# Set up a 'Hello Microverse' project ðŸ‘‹

**Author:** Javier Grau - _**[Contact Info](#contact-the-author)**_

## â­•What is this project about?

In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository in order to master all of the tools and best practices I have learned about in previous steps during my Microverse Full Stack bootcamp. 
I was adviced that I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them! 
Also I will also get my first code review and I hope it goes well because this is also a process that will be used in all Microverse projects.

## â­•What should I have learn once is finished?

- Write descriptive and easy to understand commit messages.
- Write a descriptive and easy to understand README in business English for a submitted project.
- Write short, detailed, and easy to understand descriptions of pull requests.
- Fix mistakes when making commits.
- Communicate technical concepts to non-technical people.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.
